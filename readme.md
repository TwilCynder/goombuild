# Goombuild : A Simple Makefile Generator

One I wrote a Makefile so simple and yet so functional that I started using it in all my projects. Except everytime I had to change just a few things (directory names, link/compile options, etc), and it would be nicer if I could just put these few things in a YAML file.  
So I made a program that does that.  

Goombuild reads a build configuration from a YAML file, and generates a ready-to-use Makefile. The Makefile generated is very simple, readable, and best-suited for small projects (even though it can handle many different cases). It is similar to [Premake](https://premake.github.io/), with more readable Makefiles and a bit less features at the time. 

## Installing 
`cargo install goombuild`
